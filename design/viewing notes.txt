change tilesWithinView and tilesWithinDimView to be tiles_within_party_normal_view
and tiles_within_party_dim_view, keep in game.py?
this changes it from being the total viewed tiles always used to the party viewed tiles
which is only used when SHARED_SIGHT is in effect

create tiles_currently_in_normal_view in mainview.py
create tiles_currently_in_dim_view in mainview.py
these contain actual list of tiles currently displayed
they can be switched from char to char, or from char to party or vice versa

viewlevelchanges should be in mainview.py, and can be determined
from 2 new variables described above
