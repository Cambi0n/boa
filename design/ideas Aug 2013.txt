Do away with standard and move actions

Use 10 time intervals, 0.5 sec each
Actions take a certain time interval
Moving 1 square typically takes 1 time interval

OR
Use 4 time intervals, 2 sec each
one action per time interval
can move 2 (or 3) squares per time interval
(idea is to simplify coordination among human players, only
4 phases to  time things)

Have limited "life" = hp.  Say 1 or 2 (or more at higher levels)
Have stamina points.  Most actions use stamina.
Defending uses stamina too.  More stamina used if wearing heavy armor.
Stamina points start out high, say in the hundreds (or thousands at higher levels).
When stamina gets low, defense (and offense?) becomes worse.
When stamina gets low, movement is slower.
There are 2 kinds of "doing nothing" during a time interval:
	improve defense (no stamina gain)
	gain stamina (no defense improvement)

Basic idea is that it only takes 1 or 2 good hits to the body to kill.
But most of the fight is spent fending off the big blows.
Eventually one side wears down and the big blows slip through and kill.

On defense, stamina represents orderly defense such as dodging and blocking.
When stamina is high, the chance to dodge or block an average attack is quite high, say 98%.

On offense, low stamina means the chance to overcome a dodge or block is low due to slow movements.

To score a hit to hp requires getting past both the stamina defense and armor.
Something like the following tables:
Stamina		chance to overcome
500 (full)	1%
400		3%
300		5%
200		10%
100		20%
0		55%

OR
Stamina		chance to overcome
500 (full)	0.1%
400		0.2%
300		0.4%
250		0.8%
249		5%
200		5%
100		5%
99		10%
50		10%
49		25%
0		55%

Armor		chance to overcome
12		10%
10		15%
8		20%
6		25%
4		40%
2		60%
0		80%

Cold causes temporary reduction in stamina (for as long as cold exists)
acid causes permanent, but gradual reduction in armor
fire causes direct loss of hp, but takes time

weapons differ in:
	the amount of stamina to swing
	the amount of stamina required to defend against it? Or make defense stamina usage depend on combat move only?
	bonus to overcome armor
	time interval to swing?

different combat moves may:
	require different stamina to execute (modify weapon stamina usage?)
	cause different stamina usage to defend against (again, modified from weapon base?)
	modified chance to overcome armor
	modified damage to hp once past armor
	different time interval used
	cause temporary reduction in stamina level (stun, etc)
	hit multiple targets

Have 2 kinds of mana pools.  One for ordinary magical actions.  One for extraordinary, once per day kind of things.
Maybe the second mana pool is only available if you find a rare potion.  One potion per extraordinary action.
Adds strategy, when to use the extraordinary action.  Plus fun to find the super potion.

Normal magic casting uses stamina, not mana?

Have mental stamina in addition to physical stamina?  Wouldn't mental stamina be same as mana then?
