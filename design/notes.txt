things that aren't implemented strictly according to Pathfinder rules
- detect spells act like burst rather than emanation
- detect spells don't overwhelm if aura source twice char level
- no lingering auras
- light and vision: there are 4 light levels, bright, normal, dim, ultradim.
  The ultradim setting was necessary to handle low light vision.  Objects
  have ranges of normal and dim, but creature with low light vision can
  see twice as far, indicating the ability to see in light less than
  dim.  Default values are ultradim = 1, dim = 5, normal = 10, bright = 50
  So 2 dim sources make a tile normal light, but it takes 5 ultradim
  to make dim.
- touch spells and multiple targets: When players are moving simultaneously,
  it would be annoying to have to be in a static place while the caster runs
  around touching, or to time it perfectly.  Instead, I turn most 'touch
  multiple targets' spells into burst spells.  This does change things, since
  the caster can now do more 'non-touching' movement, but targets that might
  not be within line of effect from a single casting point won't both be able
  to be targeted.

things not implemented yet:
- endure elements spell
- detect spells change move_mode to phased if they detect enemy
- concealment and cover from terrain
- detection via sound, smell, tremorsense

rules questions and my implementation:
- spell resistance, only use highest if multiple sources
- miss chances, use 1 roll, but that roll uses multiplication of 'not miss' chances.
  For example, if a target has 2 miss chances from different sources, each of 20%, then
  total miss chance will be 1 - (0.8*0.8) = 36%.  This is equivalent to making 2 rolls
  each at 20% miss chance.
- usage of detect spells when not in initiative mode.  How often do you get to choose
  new area for detection?  I choose 15 sec.
  
game details:
- a mobile object is either a monster or a class_based_mobile_object
- monsters have monster_type (and possibly monster_subtype) class_based mobile objects have race
- a class_based_mobile_object can have an .objtype of 'monster'
